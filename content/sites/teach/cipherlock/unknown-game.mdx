Dieses Spiel scheint leider nicht zu existieren.

Idea:
â€“ Player opens an onboarding or question page
- The frontend places a checkin call to the server with the stored gameId and playerId
- If this game is not active or the player isn't registered there, the call comes back negative; in that case, we show this page.
