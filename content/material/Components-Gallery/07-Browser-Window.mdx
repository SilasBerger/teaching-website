  ## Web browser

  A **web browser** is an application for accessing [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) and the
  [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the
  browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a
  range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have
  used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices, followed by
  Safari with 18%.

  A web browser is not the same thing as a [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine), though the two
  are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a
  website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts,
  browsers are referred to as user agents.

  ## Firefox
  **Mozilla Firefox**, or simply **Firefox**, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation
  and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. It uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages, which implements
  current and anticipated web standards. In November 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code
  name "Quantum" to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface. Firefox is available for Windows 10 or
  later versions, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems,
  including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix. It is also available for Android and iOS.
