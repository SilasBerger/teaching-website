# Tabs :seeCode[https://github.com/SilasBerger/teaching-website/blob/main/content/material/Components-Gallery/09-Tabs.mdx]
Tabs are a builtin component provided by the Docusaurus default theme.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  :::Tab[Windows]{value="win"}
  :::tip[Tips for Windows]
  Here's how to do this on Windows.
  :::

  :::Tab[macOS]{value="macos"}
  :::tip[Tips for macOS]
  Here's how to do this on macOS.
  :::

  :::Tab[Linux]{value="linux"}
  :::tip[Tips for Linux]
  Here's how to do this on Linux.
  :::
</Tabs>

Interesting to know: The above tab group is set to have a `groupId` of `operating-systems`. If we now add a second group with the same `groupId`, you will notice that both groups change their selected tab whenever we change it in either one of them. The  exception here being the `FreeBSD` tab: Since it only exists within the second group, selecting that tab won't affect the state of the first one.

## What doesn't work yet...
- We can't yet use MDI shorthands such as `:mdi[microsoft-windows]` within tab titles (or within Admonition titles, for that matter).
- The `:::Tabs` shorthand doesn't yet work properly. For now, we need to use the `<Tabs></Tabs>` HTML block.
