# Tabs :seeCode[https://github.com/SilasBerger/teaching-website/blob/main/content/material/Components-Gallery/09-Tabs.mdx]
Tabs are a builtin component provided by the Docusaurus default theme.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value='win' label="Windows">
    Here's what you need to do on Windows...
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='macos' label="macOS">
    Here's what you need to do on macOS...
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='linux' label="Linux">
    Here's what you need to do on Linux...
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Interesting to know: The above tab group is set to have a `groupId` of `operating-systems`. If we now add a second group with the same `groupId`, you will notice that both groups change their selected tab whenever we change it in either one of them. The  exception here being the `FreeBSD` tab: Since it only exists within the second group, selecting that tab won't affect the state of the first one.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value='win' label="Windows">
    Some more information about Windows.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='macos' label="macOS">
    Some more information about macOS.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='linux' label="Linux">
    Some more information about Linux.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='freebsd' label="FreeBSD">
    Some information about FreeBSD.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
