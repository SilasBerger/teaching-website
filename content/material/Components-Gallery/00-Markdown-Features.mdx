## Footnotes
Footnotes[^1] are a great[^2] way to move additional information to the bottom of the page.[^5]

[^1]: "**Footnotes** are notes at the foot of the page _[...]_". ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography)))
[^2]: **great** _(adj.)_: 1. _notably large in size._ 3. _remarkable in magnitude, degree, or effectiveness._
      ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/great))
[^5]: An especially useful feature of the way MDX handles footnotes is that you don't need to ensure a continuous
      enumeration. Additionally, you can define your footnotes right where you reference them, and they will still
      be placed at the end of the page.
