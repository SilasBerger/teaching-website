## Mermaid diagrams
Mermaid is a plugin for rendering complex diagrams from Markdown code blocks. In Docusaurus, it is provided by the
`@docusaurus/theme-mermaid` plugin as described [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/diagrams).

A simple Mermaid diagram can look as follows:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

Here are some examples from the [Mermaid website](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/examples.html):

### Pie chart
```mermaid
pie title NETFLIX
    "Time spent looking for movie" : 90
    "Time spent watching it" : 10
```

### Sequence diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

### Git graph
```mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit "Ashish"
    branch newbranch
    checkout newbranch
    commit id:"1111"
    commit tag:"test"
    checkout main
    commit type: HIGHLIGHT
    commit
    merge newbranch
    commit
    branch b2
    commit
```
