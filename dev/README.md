# Dev Notes
## Idea: collectionConfig
Subdomains such as `teach`, `learn`, `gbsl` and `lerbermatt` are considered collections. A collection consists of a set
of behaviours and a set of docs configs. The `collectionConfig` illustrates the concept with some first ideas.

## Legacy README content
### Config files
- `config/builderConfig.ts`: Set global material and script root directories.
- `config/siteProperties/<site>.siteProperties.ts`: Define general properties and global elements for `<site>`.
- `config/siteProperties/siteProperties.ts`: Collect all `<site>.siteProperties` definitions.
- `config/sidebars/<site>.sidebars.ts`: Define the sidebar configuration for `<site>`.
- `config/scriptsConfigs/<site>.scriptsConfigs.yaml`: Define the scripts configurations for `<site>`.

### Examples: Common configuration workflows
#### Configuring a new site called `mySite`
- Create a scripts configs file `config/scriptsConfigs/mySite.scriptsConfigs.yaml`.
- Create a sidebar file `config/sidebars/mySite.sidebars.ts` with one entry for each script defined in `mySite.scriptsConfigs.yaml`.
- Create a site properties file `config/siteProperties/mySite.siteProperties.ts`.
- Add an entry for `mySite` in `config/siteProperties/siteProperties.ts`.
- Create a directory `content/sites/mySite`.
- If required: Add the new site to the deployment pipeline's matrix definition.

#### Configuring a new script `someScript` for a site `mySite`
- Add a script config object `"someScript": {markers: {}, mappings: []}` to `config/scriptsConfigs/mySite.scriptsConfigs.yaml`.
- Define markers and mappings as needed.
- Add an entry for `someScript` to `config/sidebars/mySite.sidebars.ts`.
- Make sure to include a mapping with `{"section": "/index.md", ...}` to have a proper entry page for the script.

## Content configuration
### Pages
The pages root is defined in the `SiteProperties#pagesRoot` property in `config/siteProperties/<site>.siteProperties.ts`
for a given site. The contents of the pages root directory are served `/`.

**Warning:** Make sure that the URL paths for pages and scrips do not collide! Examples:
- Example 1: Okay, no collision; `index.md` and the `hello-in-10-languages` script root are siblings in `/greetings/`
  - Page path: `/greetings/index.md`
  - Script root: `/greetings/hello-in-10-languages` (from a script definition `"greetings/hello-in-10-languages": {...}`)
- Example 2: Problematic, collision; `index.md` sits inside the `/hello-in-10-languages` script root
  - Page path: `/greetings/hello-in-10-languages/index.md`
  - Script root: `/greetings/hello-in-10-languages`

### Scripts
A script is a unique collection of elements from the material library. As such, it is a function of the material library
and a set of configurations, executed and applied by the sync mechanism. From a technical point of view, the sync
mechanism is a parameterized file copy process, where the sources and destinations are defined through configuration.

The root directory for the material library is defined by `builderConfig.ts#MATERIAL_ROOT`. The root directory for
the scripts output directory is defined by `builderConfig.ts#SCRIPTS_ROOT`. The latter contains all script roots for
a given site after building for that site (`SITE=mySite yarn run build`).

There are two ways to specify which material library elements should be copied to a particular script: the
_scripts config_ and _markers. These two approaches can be combined can be combined at will, whereby multiple library
elements may point to the same destination in the script. In such cases, the following precedence rules define which
of these library elements (in this case, called _source candidates_) will be copied the contested destination:

1. The candidate that was explicitly (i.e. not recursively) mapped by a mapping entry in the script config.
2. Out of the candidates which explicitly (i.e. not recursively) matched a marker, the one with the highest specificity
   (=lower specificity number).
3. The candidate that was implicitly mapped my a mapping entry in the script config (i.e. the child of an explicitly
   mapped parent directory).
4. Out of the candidates which implicitly matched a marker (i.e. children of a parent directory that matched a marker), 
   the one with the highest specificity (=lower specificity number).

#### The scripts configs file
An excerpt of the scripts configs file `<mySite>.scriptsConfigs.yaml` for a site `mySite` might look as follows:
```yaml
{
  "english": { # this object defines a script named "english"; its URL path will be /english
    "markers": { # markers definition (see below)
      "english": 0, # marker "english" has specificity 0 (the lower the number, the higher the precedence)
      "languages": 1 # marker "languages" has specificity 1
    },
    "mappings": [ # mappings definition
      # recursively copy the /General-Information directory from the material library to /01-General-Information in
      # the script 
      {"section": "/01-General-Information", "material": "/General-Information"},
      {"section": "/02-Units/01-Unit-1", "material": "/English/Units/Unit-1"},
      {"section": "/02-Units/02-Unit-2", "material": "/English/Units/Unit-2"}
    ]
  },
  "programming": {
    "markers": {
      "programming": 0
    },
    "mappings": [
      {"section": "/01-General-Information", "material": "/General-Information"},
      {
        # recursively copy the /Computer-Science/Programming/01-Introduction directory from the material library
        # to /02-Introduction-to-Programming in the script, but...
        "section": "/02-Introduction-to-Programming",
        "material": "/Computer-Science/Programming/01-Introduction",
        # ...from /Computer-Science/Programming/01-Introduction, ignore the file 04-Loops/03-do-while.mdx and the
        # entire "06-Exceptions" directory
        "ignore": ["04-Loops/03-do-while.mdx", "06-Exceptions"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Markers
If a directory or filename contains a segment of the form `.[]`, it is considered _marked_. Any comma-separated values
within the two brackets are considered _markers_. For example, the file `hello.[foo,bar].md` has two markers: `foo` and
`bar`.

During the sync process for a given script, the following rules apply to all marked files (and directories):
- If none of the script's markers (as defined by its markers definition) match any of that file's markers, then that
  file is ignored.
- If any of the file's markers match any of the script's markers, the file considered a source candidate for a
  destination file with the same name, but with the marker section removed. For example: a marked source file
  `hello.[foo,bar].md` would become a source candidate for a destination file `hello.md`.
- Multiple marked files may be considered source candidates for the same destination file.
- Source candidates inherit their specificity from the specificity of their most specific applicable marker (=lowest
  number). For example: a script defines a marker `foo` with specificity `3` and a marker `bar` with specificity `1`,
  then the source candidate `hello.[foo,bar,baz].md` will receive a specificity of `1`.
- Multiple applicable markers on a given file may not have equal specificity within a given script.
- Multiple source candidates for a given destination file may not yield equal specificity.

Additional useful information about the behavior of markers:
- Directories with unmatched markers do not prevent their children with matched markers from being used as source
  candidates. For example: If a script has a marker `[foo]`, it will ignore a directory such as `Some-Topic.[bar]`
  per-se. However, it will nevertheless discover and include its `foo`-marked children, such as
  `Some-Topic.[bar]/A-Sub-Topic.[foo]/*` or `Some-Topic.[bar]/an-article.[foo].mdx`
- File or directory names with an empty marker list (e.g. `some-article.[].md`, `Some-Topic.[]`) are still considered
  marked, even though they will not match any applicable markers. This behavior can be used to "mark" a file or
  directory as an unpublished draft.
- When working on a page that should not (yet) be mapped into any scripts (e.g. a placeholder page while developing
  a new component), it is recommended to use the `drafts` site as a drafting and development playground. Either
  add an explicit mapping to `drafts.scriptsConfigs.yaml`, or mark a file or directory with `draft` (or any other)
  draft-specific marker defined in `drafts.scriptsConfigs.yaml`), e.g. `Path/To/Some/future-article.[draft].md`. Since
  marked elements are discovered even when nested in a non-marked path, that file (and its parent hierarchy) will
  be included in any draft script with marker `draft`.

#### The final result
Assuming a material tree that looks as follows:
```shell
├── General-Information
│   ├── Required-Materials.[english]
│   │   ├── 01-Stationary.md

The final `english` script at `/path/to/scripts/english` will look as follows:

## Concepts: Material, sites, pages, scripts, and the sync mechanism
### Material
The material library is a central collection of sections and articles in the form of Markdown files. For every site,
these sections and articles are selectively assembled into individual scripts as needed. The root directory for the
material library is defined by `builderConfig.ts#MATERIAL_ROOT`.

### Sites
A site represents...
- from a technical point of view: a unique build target.
- from the website creator's point of view: a specific deployment configuration, defined by its unique collection of
  pages and scripts.
- from the website user's point of view: a unique website.

A site is defined by a set of configuration files and entries as described in the [General configuration](#general-configuration)
section.

### Pages
The [Docusaurus pages plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages) is used to create on-off standalone pages.
These are individual Markdown files that are not part of any particular script. Pages can for instance be used to create
landing pages or entrypoints for navigating to scripts.

Each site defines a pages root directory in its `config/siteProperties/<site>.siteProperties.ts` configuration file.
The contents of that directory are served at `/`. Looking at the following folder structure:

```shell
content
└── pages
    └── mysite
        ├── index.md  # page
        └── greetings
            └── hello-world.md  # page
```

Assuming that we are building the site `mysite`, and that the `pagesRoot` for `mysite` is set to `content/pages/mysite`.
We would then see the resulting HTML files for our markdown file served as follows:
- for `index.md`: `/` and `/index.html`
- for `hello-world.md`: `/greetings/hello-world` and `/greetings/hello-world.html`

### Scripts
A script is a unique collection of elements from the material library. It is defined by an entry in the site's
`*.scriptsConfigs.yaml` file. The contents of the script are arranged via mapping entries in that scripts config entry,
as well as through matching markers between the scripts config and filenames in the material library.

When building the respective site, each script definition yields a [docs root](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/routing)
for the [Docusaurus Docs plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction). On that site, that docs root is served
at `/<scriptId>`.

### The sync mechanism
The sync mechanism is used to assemble contents from the material library into each individual script, as defined by 
that scripts configuration in the site's `*.scriptsConfigs.yaml` file and any applicable markers in the material
filenames. `docusaurus.config.ts` marks the entrypoint into the build and sync process.
