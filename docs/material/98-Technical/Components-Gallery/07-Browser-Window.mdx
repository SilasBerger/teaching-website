  ## Web browser

  A **web browser** is an application for accessing [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) and the
  [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the
  browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a
  range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have
  used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices, followed by
  Safari with 18%.

  A web browser is not the same thing as a [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine), though the two
  are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a
  website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts,
  browsers are referred to as user agents.
