# Markdown and HTML Features

## Standard features

All **standard features** you would _expect_ from `Markdown` are available [here](#) as well.

## Code blocks
A simple code block:
```py
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

A code block with line numbers and a highlighted section:
```html {3-6} showLineNumbers
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My first website</h1>
    <div>
        <span>This is my first website!</span>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Blockquotes
> Thou dost snore distinctly.\
> Thereâ€™s meaning in thy snores.
>
> :::Cite
> Shakespeare, William. _The Tempest_. 2.1.244-245.

## Footnotes
Footnotes[^1] are a great[^2] way to move additional information to the bottom of the page.[^5]

[^1]: "**Footnotes** are notes at the foot of the page _[...]_". ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography)))
[^2]: **great** _(adj.)_: 1. _notably large in size._ 3. _remarkable in magnitude, degree, or effectiveness._
      ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/great))
[^5]: An especially useful feature of the way MDX handles footnotes is that you don't need to ensure a continuous
      enumeration. Additionally, you can define your footnotes right where you reference them, and they will still
      be placed at the end of the page.
